# Recursive Cancer
A simulation of small organisms living, breathing and growing on a hexagonal grid with one catch: cancers are prevalent. Each cell the organism tries to grow to (and is unopposed) there's a chance that the cell will instead become it's own organism but still will be recognized as ally by the primal organism ... at least for some time. It will become a cancer, growing, overcoming and eating the one that spawned it. But cancers are organisms too and they can get cancer as well ...
